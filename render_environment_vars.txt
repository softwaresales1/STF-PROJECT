Deployment Instructions:
- In the Render dashboard, go to your service's Environment section.
- Add the above environment variables with their respective values.
- Ensure SECRET_KEY is kept secret and not exposed publicly.
- Set DEBUG to 'False' in production.
- Provide correct DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL for your database and Redis instances.
- Configure email credentials for sending emails.
- If using cloud storage, set USE_CLOUD_STORAGE to 'True' and provide AWS credentials.
- The PORT variable should match the port your app listens on (default 10000).
- The RENDER variable can be set to 'True' or any value to enable Render-specific settings.

Troubleshooting Tips:
- Missing or incorrect DATABASE_URL or REDIS_URL can cause connection failures.
- Ensure AWS credentials have proper permissions if using cloud storage.
- Keep SECRET_KEY secure to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Check Render logs for any environment variable related errors during deployment.
