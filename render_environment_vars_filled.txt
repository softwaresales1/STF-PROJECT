12. RENDER: Set to any value to indicate running on Render platform. Used for SSL proxy settings.

Additional Notes:
- SECRET_KEY is set from DJANGO_SECRET_KEY environment variable.
- DEBUG is hardcoded to False in settings.py for safety.
- ALLOWED_HOSTS includes Render domain and other domains.
- SSL proxy header is set if RENDER environment variable is present.
- Database config uses DATABASE_URL if set, otherwise falls back to individual DB_* variables (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT) with defaults:
    - DB_USER: 'ADMIN'
    - DB_PASSWORD: 'Falcon85h#'
    - DB_HOST: 'localhost'
    - DB_PORT: '5432'

Deployment Instructions:
- In the Render dashboard, go to your service's Environment section.
- Add the above environment variables with their respective values.
- Replace placeholder values with your actual secrets and credentials.
- Keep DJANGO_SECRET_KEY secure and do not expose publicly.
- Set DEBUG to 'False' in production.
- Provide correct DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL for your database and Redis instances.
- Configure email credentials for sending emails.
- Set RENDER variable to enable Render-specific settings.

Troubleshooting Tips:
- Missing or incorrect DATABASE_URL or REDIS_URL can cause connection failures.
- Ensure email credentials are correct for SMTP email sending.
- Keep SECRET_KEY secure to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Check Render logs for any environment variable related errors during deployment.
